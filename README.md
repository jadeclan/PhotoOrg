#Android Photo Organizer

App used to practice learning Visual Studio 2015 (especially Debug & GitHub features) Xamarin, SQLite, C#

The data base portions of the app were initially based on material prepared by [Absolute Sekhar Srinivas link](https://www.youtube.com/user/sekharonline4u)
in his  [Absolute You Tube video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAw0Fa92qNE).

The app is very rudimentary, but has helped in understanding state, visibility, SQLite and layout implementation.
